# a project (can) begin with an environment.
# is there a single overarching framework that defines the project? am i typesceipt or am i node?



2. Initialize a new Node.js project using `npm` or `yarn`:
   ```
   npm init -y
   # or
   yarn init -y
   ```

3. Install TypeScript and the necessary type definitions as development dependencies:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node
   # or
   yarn add --dev typescript @types/node
   ```

4. Create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure TypeScript compiler options:
   ```
   npx tsc --init
   # or
   yarn run tsc --init
   ```

   You can then modify the `tsconfig.json` file according to your project's requirements.

5. Create a `default.nix` file to define your Nix derivation for the project:
   ```nix
   { pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

   pkgs.mkShell {
     buildInputs = [
       pkgs.nodejs
       pkgs.yarn
     ];

     shellHook = ''
       export PATH="$PWD/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
     '';
   }
   ```

   This example assumes you are using `yarn` as the package manager. Adjust the `buildInputs` accordingly if you prefer `npm`.

6. Enter the Nix shell environment:
   ```
   nix-shell
   ```

   This will ensure that the necessary dependencies (Node.js and package manager) are available in your development environment.

7. Create your TypeScript source files and start writing your code. For example, create a `src` directory and add an `index.ts` file:
   ```
   mkdir src
   touch src/index.ts
   ```

8. Compile your TypeScript code to JavaScript:
   ```
   npx tsc
   # or
   yarn run tsc
   ```

   This will compile your TypeScript files and generate the corresponding JavaScript files.

9. Run your Node.js application:
   ```
   node dist/index.js
   ```

   Make sure to adjust the path to match the location of your compiled JavaScript files. 

These are the basic steps to set up a new development project with TypeScript, Node.js, and Nix. You can further customize your project structure, add more dependencies, and configure additional tools and build processes based on your specific requirements.

Remember to commit your code to version control (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate collaboration with others.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
